			<h3>About me:</h3>
			
			I am a 20 year old guy, currently studying Computer Science With A Year In Industry at the University of Kent. 
			I am very interested in programming/software development, and want to go into a career in exactly that. One of my dreams is to become a technical architect. Currently my language of choice is C#, and I see it 
			remaining that way for the foreseeable future. However, I also know Java, Erlang, Javascript, PHP, and feel comfortable picking any other languages up. I am a big fan of the .NET stack, and plan on writing a blog
			on why soon.
			</br>
			</br>
			In terms of hobbies, I'm very into gaming, music (including going to lots of live music events), films, and programming, obviously. I'm a very social person, and like to spend a lot of my time with friends, 
			rather than on my own.
