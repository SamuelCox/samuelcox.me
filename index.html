                <!-- A short explanation of who I am-->

                <p>I am a 19 year old originally from Oxford. I'm a geek with a
                passion for programming, games, science, films, and music. I am
                also a vocal feminist, an atheist and a humanist. I have been
                interested in computing all my life, and am intending on
                finding a career in software engineering or information
                security. I learned my first programming language in my first
                year of my Computing A-level, at age 16. It was visual basic,
                however the syllabus only dictated we learn to create console
                applications, and I never picked the language up further. In my
                second year of Computing A-level, I learned the language
                Processing to create a project. You can find out more about
                that project and download it below. Since then, I have moved on
                to Java as my main language of choice, as I have learned it for
                my first year of University, and in general enjoy it as a
                programming language. I intend on creating as many programs as
                my time reasonably allows for over the summer. I would also
                like to learn some functional languages, and the C family of
                languages soon. Some of these I will learn during my time in my
                degree, so I will still mainly be working in Java. Finally, I
                really, really like monospace fonts. I have also recently
                learned C#, and really enjoy the language.</p>

        27/11/2014 : Reuploaded the CSV_Sorter project, as the one hosted here
        was actually an old version with the wrong about info, and no

    <div class="content" style="width:733px">
        This was my first proper project I worked on. In the second year of
        A-level computing, we had to work on a project of our own, that had to
        have a real target end user. This project is designed as a Virtual
        Learning Environment (VLE) to help teach AS-level Physics. It also
        contains definitions and terms exactly as taught and defined in the OCR
        syllabus. It is coded entirely in Processing, which was the easiest
        language to code it with at the time, all things considered. If wanted,
        I can produce various documentation we had to create along with it.
        Some of the simulations use an algorithm created by Daniel Shiffman.

        This is my first personal project that I haven't been mandated to work
        on for academia. I'm quite proud of it, although it is a simple
        program. It is a program coded in java that allows the user to open a
        CSV file, sort it, and then export the sorted CSV to a file. It also
        allows some basic editing of the CSV, though that wasn't the
        functionality I was working on. Also, I found that as I worked on this,
        I actually ended up liking the java look and feel rather than windows
        look and feel, which was rather odd to me! I would imagine for pretty
        much anything other than this program it will be the other way around!

        NoiseBot v0.95 - An IRC bot
    </div>

    <div><img alt="Image not Available" src="ircscreenshot.jpg"></div><br>

    <div class="content" style="width:733px">
        I had been meaning to learn C# for quite a while, so I took the
        opportunity to kill 2 birds with 1 stone, and learned C# by making an
        IRC bot with it, as this was one of the programs I was also quite keen
        on making. This bot is a fairly lightweight CLI bot. If a user sends a
        private message "!help" to a channel, it will display all it's
        commands. Currently, there is a roll the dice function, a fun Russian
        roulette game function, a quote function that messages the channel some
        of my favourite quotes, and a kick all function, available to operators
        only, of course. It is not yet full release as there is a trivial bug I
        am trying to sort, it displays what it reads from the network stream in
        the console, but this also overwrites the user's cli commands if they
        can't finish it before another message. The only CLI command available
        at the moment is quit, which closes the program.
